    <h1 class="head4">Transport</h1>The School provides the children with an excellent bus facility which has routes that cover all of Indore with stops at regular intervals. The schoolâ€™s fleet of 74 buses criss-cross on routes covering the entire city. The buses are spacious with a capacity to accomodate 44 seats for students in every bus. The teachers ensure discipline in the bus so that the bus rules are not flouted. The school bus drivers are responsible to drop the children at their stops within an hour of the school getting over. At the moment, the school runs two separate routes for junior and senior students.</body>
