        <p>For more than six decades, 
            the DPS Society has developed with a spirit and a vision.
             Today it stands as a citadel of learning and a harbinger of 
             quality consciousness committed to developing the minds and initiative
             s of children. The vitality of the classrooms, the energy of the
              playing fields and the open friendliness of the work environment, 
              have enabled DPS students to reach their fullest potential â€“ whether 
              the scoring distinctions in the board examinations or winning national 
              / international accolades in drama, debates or sports. Outstanding board results and securing 
              enviable positions in the entrance tests to various professional 
              colleges and institutes of international repute are the 
              accepted identity of a DPS school.</p>
